1.  Introduction

   TODO Introduction

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  KEM security properties

3.1.  IND-CCA

   TODO.  Explain adaptive attacks (Bleichenbacher) to explain passive
   security is not enough.  Define IND-CCA.

3.2.  Binding properties

   TODO.  Refer to 2023/1933, 2024/702 for the various binding
   properties, and attacks.

3.3.  Security properties of hybrid KEMs

   TODO.  IND-CCA robustness

   TODO.  Component reuse.

3.4.  Recommended baseline

   IND-CCA, LEAK+-BIND

4.  Combiners from literature

   TODO.  Refer to 2018/024, 2024/039, etc. and how these

5.  PQ/T hybrids

5.1.  X25519+Kyber768

5.2.  P384+MLKEM1024

5.2.1.  Encoding and sizes

   P384+MLKEM1024 encapsulation key, decapsulation key, ciphertext and
   shared secrets are all fixed length byte strings.

   Decapsulation key (private):  3360 bytes

   Encapsulation key (public):  1664 bytes

   Ciphertext:  1664 bytes

   Shared secret:  32 bytes

5.2.2.  Key generation

   A P384+MLKEM1024 keypair (decapsulation key, encapsulation key) is
   generated as follows.

   def GenerateKeyPair():
     (pk_M, sk_M) = ML-KEM-1024.KeyGen()
     sk_E = P-384-KeyGen(32)
     pk_E = P-384-DH(sk_E, P384_BASE)
     return concat(sk_M, sk_E, pk_E), concat(pk_M, pk_E)

5.2.2.1.  Key derivation

5.2.3.  Combiner

   Given 32 byte strings ss_M, ss_E, and 96 byte strings ct_X, pk_X,
   representing the ML-KEM-1024 shared secret, P-384 shared secret,
   P-384 ciphertext (ephemeral public key) and P-384 public key
   respectively, the 32 byte combined shared secret is given by:

   def Combiner(ss_M, ss_E, ct_E, pk_E):
       return SHA3-X(concat(
           # TBD
       ))

5.2.4.  Encapsulation

   def Encapsulate(pk):
       # TBD

5.2.4.1.  Derandomized

5.2.5.  Decapsulation

   def Decapsulate(ct, sk):
       # TBD

5.3.  (P256+MLKEM768)
